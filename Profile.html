  <p style="color:white;">My name is Ariana Johnson. I'm 19 years old, and currently a college sophmore at the Catholic University of America. I'm majoring in computer science, so, along with other trivial facts about me, here you will find some of the projects I've worked on/been working on these past years. Check 'em out!
